I used AJAX to call gifs from a giphy API.  I used encodeURI to allow user to search for their own category, and it will pull 10 gifs tagged with matching words when you click on the topic button.  I also created a click function that starts the paused gifs, and if you click again it will pause them. I chose strong women, because I wanted to make this inspiring.
